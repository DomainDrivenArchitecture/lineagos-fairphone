# Upgrading your LineagOS
If there is a new major release, we can not use the update-app. We have to do some manual wor for the upgrade.

* You can follow the instructions found here: https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/FP3/upgrade
* After Step 5. `adb sideload /path/to/zip` its okay if your adb says `Total xfer: 1.00x`
* The relevant output should be on your Phone Step 2 / 2
