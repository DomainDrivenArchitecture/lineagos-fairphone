# OsmAnd

OsmAnd is a navigation app, it is based on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) map database. The data can be stored locally for offline use.

In the F-Droid store you get OsmAnd~, which is a version without GooglePlay services. As a there are no Google dependencies the	voice output does not work because TextToSpeech (TTS) is not installed.  
Through the [AuroraStore]() you can install the speech services (unfortunately) by Google. Then you can activate TTS in OsmAnd~ and use your navigation app.

## Navigation with Speech-Output
Using eSpeak (available on F-droid) now the navigation with spoken instructions is possible.
