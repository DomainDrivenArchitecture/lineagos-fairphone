# OsmAnd

OsmAnd is a navigation app, it is based on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) map database. The Data can be stored locally for offline use.

In the F-Droid store you get OsmAnd~, which is a version without GooglePlay services. As a there are no Google dependencies the	voice output does not work because TextToSpeech (TTS) is not installed.  
This can be done through the [AuroraStore]().
