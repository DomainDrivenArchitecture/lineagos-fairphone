## How to synchronize the calendar of your computer with your smartphone without Google

A very popular and favoured feature of Google is the possibility to synchronize all your devices very easy. The downside is that for all those "free features" you don't have to pay with cash, but you pay with your data.\
Here we suggest a possibility how to bypass Google and still synchronize all your devices very easy.

One way is to use the Nextcloud, [here][nextcloud] you can sign up and get a cloud hostet e.g. in Germany with up to 5GB for free. There you can store all your data without concern. If you want even more security, you can even host your [own cloud-server][owncloud] with Nextcloud.\
If you want to synchronize your calendar through your devices, first download the Nextcloud app. Now you only have to install DAVx⁵ from the F-Droid Store which helps you to sync your calendar and contacts (for further informations see [here][davx5]).

If you don't want to use Nextcloud, you can use FOSS (Free and open-source) apps like [Simple Mobile Tools][smt] or [Etar][etar]. Both apps are available in the F-Droid Store and can also be synchronized with the help of [DAVx⁵][davx5].
