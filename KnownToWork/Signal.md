# Signal

Signal is another messenger, a huge benefit is that Signal is Open-Source and the end-to-end decryption keeps you data secure. 

Signal is recommended by many privacy advocates like Edward Snowden and is moreover an independent nonprofit.

# Privacy

All your messages are stored locally on your device, so the messages you send only exist on Signalâ€™s servers during transit where they are end-to-end encrypted.  
As long as your phone is safe, your Signal messages are safe as well.

Because your data are only stored locally you have to perform a backup of your messages if you want to keep them after changing your phone or before installing LineageOS. Therefore you have to create a backup-file.
