# DeltaChat

Delta Chat is like Telegram or Whatsapp but without the tracking or central control. Delta Chat does not need your phone number. Check out our privacy statement.

Delta Chat doesnâ€™t have their own servers but uses the most massive and diverse open messaging system ever: the existing e-mail server network.

Chat with anyone if you know their e-mail address, no need for them to install DeltaChat! All you need is a standard e-mail account.

# Privacy

You own only data on your own server. If you own a mail server, DeltaChat is a nice alternative. You don't need an additional chat server but you will own your messages.
