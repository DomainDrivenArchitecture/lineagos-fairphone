# AuroraStore

The AuroraStore works as a FOSS (Free-and-Open-Source-Software)-Client for the googlePlay Store. With the AuroraStore you can anonymously download every apk from the PlayStore.  
The advantage is, that you neither need a google account nor any other googlePlay Services. Another very beneficial aspect is that the AuroraStore has included the exodus-portal (which we already recommanded in our README) that provides privacy audits for all apps and shows you all trackers.

Unfortunately there are many apps that require parts of the googleServiceFramework (GSF). Those apps are tagged in the AuroraStore and may not work. Nevertheless there are also many apps which are tagged but work completely fine.
If you need apps which require GSF you can install MicroG. MicroG is a free software clone of googles core libraries and applications.
