## Rational

As it is widely known that Google tries to collect data from all possible sources, we offer a method where you can restrict many Google Services. We provide a manual for these restrictions for the Fairphone. There we install LineageOS instead of Android and furthermore we remove unnecessary functions like Google DNS or replacing the Play Store with the Open-Source based F-Droid Store.
For more details or further functions, we remove take a look at our [installation_guide](https://gitlab.com/domaindrivenarchitecture/ungoogled-fairphone/-/blob/main/installation_guide.md).
