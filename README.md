## Rational
### Security matters

The biggest issue in terms of security is the lack of updates. Your android smartphone will be updated by your provider (if there are any) for one or two years. LineageOS provides much longer updates. The oldest device we suport (a htcOne) is now supported by more than 8 years.

### Privacy matters

As it is widely known that Google tries to collect data from all possible sources. These collected data gives a incredible power to the collector. We think, giving google all this power is harmful.

## Installation

We've enhanced the LineageOS installation guide in order to provide a complete walkthrough for the fairphone including bootloader-unlocking, degoogling & App-Installation.

1. [Prepare installation](Guides/PrepareInstallation.md)
2. LineageOs installation
3. degoogle your phone


## Live without Google is possible

->> Known to work ...


For more details and more information about specific google functions and dependencies we have removed, take a look at our [installation_guide][guide]. There you get all relevant information and you can ungoogle your fairphone all by yourself.

## How to bypass Google

We have created some references how you can bypass Google and still benefit from the features that Google normally provides.

[Here][messenger] you can see how you can use your messenger of choice without the need of a Google-account.

[Here][calendar] you can see how you can synchronize the a calendar through multiple devices without using Google.

## Things not working

If you are interested how an arbitrary app is tracking you, we can recommend the [exodus][privacy] platform, another website which is highly recommendable for a safer smartphone usage is [mobilsicher][privacyII].
