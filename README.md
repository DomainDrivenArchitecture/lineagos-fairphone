## Rational
### Security matters

The biggest issue in terms of security is the lack of updates. Your android smartphone will be updated by your provider (if there are updates at all) for one or two years. LineageOS provides much longer updates. The oldest device we support (a htcOne) is now getting updates for more than 8 years.


### Privacy matters

As it is widely known that Google tries to collect data from all possible sources. These collected data gives a incredible power to the collector. We think, giving google all this power is harmful. We will do our best to stopp google from collecting data from our lives.


## Installation

We've enhanced the LineageOS installation guide in order to provide a complete walkthrough for the fairphone including bootloader-unlocking, degoogling & App-Installation.

1. [Prepare installation](Guides/PrepareInstallation.md)
2. [LineageOs installation](Guides/LineageOsInstallation.md)
3. [degoogle your phone](Guides/DegoogleLineageOs.md)

You will find more guides at [Guides/Summary.md](Guides/Summary.md)

## Things not working

But obviosly there are also things not working without google (google-pay  or google-search for example). We will collect these things here and describe alterantives if possible.
