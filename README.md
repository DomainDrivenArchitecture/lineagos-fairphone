## Our Motivation
### Security matters

The biggest security issue on your android smartphone is the lack of updates after some time. 
Usually updates will be rolled out for one or two years and then the manufacturer stops the support. 
LineageOS provides updates over a much longer period of time. The oldest supported device, HTC One (M8), is now reveiving updates for more than 8 years.

### Privacy matters

It is widely known that google collects data about people from all possible sources. 
We think this knowledge concentrated in the hands of one company is quite harmful. 
Thus we will do our best to stop google from gathering data from your and our lives.

## Installation

We have enhanced the LineageOS installation guide for the Fairphone in order to provide a complete walkthrough including bootloader-unlocking, degoogling & app-installation.

1. [Prepare installation](Guides/1.\ PrepareInstallation.md)
2. [LineageOS installation](Guides/2.\ LineageOsInstallation.md)
3. [Degoogle your phone](Guides/3.\ DegoogleLineageOS.md)

You will find more guides at [Guides/Summary.md](Guides/Summary.md)

We will collect the most important use cases here

## Things not working

We will collect these issues here and describe alterantives if possible.
