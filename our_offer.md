# Our offer:
If you are not able or if you don't want to ungoogle your smartphone by yourself, we provide an installation service.

The first step is to check out our [README][read] and our [FAQs][faq]. Moreover, we need information about the model of your smartphone to check if LineageOS is compatible with your smartphone. 

For transportation there exist two options:
1) You want your smartphone to be transported under seal and observe the installation process.
2) You want your smartphone to be transported the standard way.

Please contact us through [info@meissa-gmbh.de][mail] or through [mastodon][mastodon] (optional you can fill in our contact formular here) and inform us about your preffered options.

Afterwards we will contact you and give you further informations about the transport process and respond to questions you might still have.

In the next step we will ungoogle your smartphone (while you might get a substitution phone for the meantime) and send it back to you as soon as it is ready. Afterwards you can enjoy your ungoogled phone and worry a bit less about your privacy and big companys swallowing your data.
