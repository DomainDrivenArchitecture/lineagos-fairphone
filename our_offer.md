For transportation there are two options:
1) You want your smartphone to be transported under seal and you want it send back again under seal.
2) You want your smartphone to be transported the standard way.

For the time while your phone gets ungoogled:
1) You can borrow one of our ungoogled Fairphones, explore the ungoogled world in the meantime and stay reachable.
2) You go on vacation and/or enjoy the time without your smartphone.

After that you should make a local backup for all the data you want to keep, as during the installation process we will reset your phone to factory settings. So store all your pictures, videos and files on your computer or your cloud (we can recommend the [Nextcloud][cloud]).

After you have a backup of all important data, please reset your smartphone back to factory settings.   

Now you can send us your smartphone.  

After you did that, we will ungoogle your phone (while you might get a substitution phone for the meantime) and send it back to you as soon as it is ready. Afterwards you can enjoy your ungoogled phone and worry a bit less about your privacy and big companys swallowing your data.
